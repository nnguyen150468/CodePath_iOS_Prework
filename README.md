## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. 
App: Grindr
Features: Users can set a PIN to unlock the app. Users cannot screenshot others's library pictures. Both are for privacy purposes.

App: Google Map
Features: app can detect how far a person is to a place. Users can get direction on how to travel.

App: Instagram
Features: ability to share private stories even if your profile is public -- good for privacy. Also, the reaction helps people interact with each other's stories easily.


App Idea: iClicker for class attendance on phone. A lot of universities require the purchase of iClicker devices so teachers in large classes can make sure students are in attendance quickly.
This is a waste of money and is not environmentally responsible, as many people only use the iClicker for one class.
Having an app on the phone, registered with the class's database, students can use the app to check in without having to buy an iClicker device.


## Notes

Challenges: not knowing where the Utilities Pane is.
